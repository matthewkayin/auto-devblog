# auto-devblog
This is a blog website written in HTML / CSS. It's called "auto-devblog" because I wrote a python script that will compile a static site together based on some HTML document templates and a folder of "post" textfiles. The idea was to get the ease-of-use in post writing that you'd expect from a wordpress site, while still being able to host the site on github pages.

The result is a functional implementation of this idea, but not one that I'm completely satisfied with. There's still a bit of work to be done in terms of making this truly responsive for mobile devices (I think the font size especially could use an increase and I might need to do further testing with different device widths on the CSS @media lines).
