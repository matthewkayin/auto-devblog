So What Now?
November 29, 2020
This was originally going to be a development blog, but I discovered that I don't like blogging that much (I like writing, though! Just not blog writing).
If you're reading this, then, it means you're either looking at my github portfolio or it means I applied to your company and your company is looking for
someone with experience in web development so I listed this as my website. Either way, there's a good chance that if you're looking at this, it means you're
somebody who's hiring a software developer and who also has access to my resume. I'd encourage you to check it out if you haven't already (I also wrote it in HTML).
And if you've already done that, I'd love for you to reach out to me for an interview! I would be thrilled for the opportunity to work at your company.
