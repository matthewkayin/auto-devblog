Get to Know Me
November 26, 2019
So who am I, anyways? Well, my name's Matt and I'm a software developer. I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Science soon,
but I started programming way before that. I was drawn to programming at an early age because I like creativity and I like problem
solving, and programming was something that combined the two. I love creating things with code and I love learning new languages or
experimenting with new technologies.
