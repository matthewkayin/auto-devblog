Introduction to the Blog
November 7, 2019
Hello this is the first blog post. This entire site was auto-generated based on templates I wrote in HTML / CSS.
I setup a folder of "posts" which are each defined via numbered text files. Then I have a python script which compiles
the posts together into a blog, complete with an archive of all the posts. That archive is the reason why I did it this way.
I originally was only going to try developing a static site, but then I realized that it would be a hassle to manually
edit the archive and the home page just to get page content going, so I created a little python script to solve that problem
for me. I have since learned that solutions like Jekyll offer a better way to do this, but this was still a great learning
experience.
