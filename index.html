				<p class="text headline">Introduction to the Blog</p>
				<p class="text date">November 7, 2019</p>
				<p class="text content">Hello this is the first blog post. This entire site was auto-generated based on templates I wrote in HTML / CSS.
							I setup a folder of "posts" which are each defined via numbered text files. Then I have a python script which compiles
							the posts together into a blog, complete with an archive of all the posts. That archive is the reason why I did it this way.
							I originally was only going to try developing a static site, but then I realized that it would be a hassle to manually
							edit the archive and the home page just to get page content going, so I created a little python script to solve that problem
							for me. I have since learned that solutions like Jekyll offer a better way to do this, but this was still a great learning
							experience.</p>

				<p class="text date">November 26, 2019</p>
				<p class="text content">So who am I, anyways? Well, my name's Matt and I'm a software developer. I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Science soon,
							but I started programming way before that. I was drawn to programming at an early age because I like creativity and I like problem
							solving, and programming was something that combined the two. I love creating things with code and I love learning new languages or
							experimenting with new technologies.</p>

				<p class="text headline">So What Now?</p>
				<p class="text date">November 29, 2020</p>
				<p class="text content">This was originally going to be a development blog, but I discovered that I don't like blogging that much (I like writing, though! Just not blog writing).
							If you're reading this, then, it means you're either looking at my github portfolio or it means I applied to your company and your company is looking for
							someone with experience in web development so I listed this as my website. Either way, there's a good chance that if you're looking at this, it means you're
							somebody who's hiring a software developer and who also has access to my resume. I'd encourage you to check it out if you haven't already (I also wrote it in HTML).
							And if you've already done that, I'd love for you to reach out to me for an interview! I would be thrilled for the opportunity to work at your company.</p>
