                <p class="text content">Hi! My name is Matt. I'm an aspiring Software Developer
                                        and a Computer Science student entering my last semester
                                        at Wichita State University.<br><br>
                                        Although I've been studying engineering, I'm a creative
                                        person at heart, and I've long held that if it weren't
                                        for coding, I would have probably majored in English or
                                        something. Instead, I fell in love with the way software
                                        development brings together creativity and problem solving.
                                        It's like a math problem where you make something at the
                                        end, and I think that's really cool.<br><br>
                                        I created this blog as a way to share my passion with
                                        anybody who cares to come and see it. Here is where I post
                                        devlogs of my current software projects. I encourage you to
                                        check it out if you haven't already! And if you're interested
                                        in seeing my work beyond what's on the blog, you find my github
